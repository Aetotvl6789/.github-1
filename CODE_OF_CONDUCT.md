# Code of Conduct

Everyone interacting in [Python Packaging Authority]-supported projects is
expected to follow the [PSF Code of Conduct]. This includes all infrastructure
used in the development of PyPA-supported projects, such as codebases, issue
trackers, chat rooms, and mailing lists.

In general, this means that everyone is expected to be **open**,
**considerate**, and **respectful** of others no matter what their position is
within the project.
